# sbl-optimizer-colab-simple
Simplified version of sbl-optimizer-colab,
a Google Colab notebook to try out sbl-optimizer. sbl-optimizer optimizes print pattern for [Swell by Light](https://sites.gatech.edu/futurefeelings/2025/03/07/swell-by-light-tei-25/).

Welcome to **sbl-optimizer**, a friendly tool that turns your images into printable patterns for 2.5D raised textures!  
Anyoneâ€”even with zero coding experienceâ€”can upload a picture, run cells, and get an optimized pattern you can print, shine light, and watch pop up like magic.

![A printed pattern's shades change as the optimization progresses, and the resulting temperature distribution gets closer to the intended pattern.](https://sites.gatech.edu/futurefeelings/files/2025/03/opt_step.gif)

Optimization of the printed pattern results in a uniform temperature pattern (right) closely matching the original pattern (left). In this example, the leaves are over-heated while the stems are under-heated before the optimization.
As the iteration number goes up, the leaves' temperature goes down while the stems' goes up, resulting in a more uniform temperature distribution.

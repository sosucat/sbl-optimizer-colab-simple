Welcome to **sbl-optimizer**, a friendly tool that turns your images into printable patterns for 2.5D raised textures!  
**This notebook is a simplified version** of the full walk-through. Anyoneâ€”even with zero coding experienceâ€”can upload a picture, run cells, and get an optimized pattern you can print, shine light, and watch pop up like magic.
If you want to understand the codes in detail, please check out the advanced Colab notebook:

![A printed pattern's shades change as the optimization progresses, and the resulting temperature distribution gets closer to the intended pattern.](https://sites.gatech.edu/futurefeelings/files/2025/03/opt_step.gif)

Optimization of the printed pattern results in a uniform temperature pattern (right) closely matching the original pattern (left). In this example, the leaves are over-heated while the stems are under-heated before the optimization.
As the iteration number goes up, the leaves' temperature goes down while the stems' goes up, resulting in a more uniform temperature distribution.
